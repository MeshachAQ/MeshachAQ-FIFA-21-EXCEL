Hello, and welcome to this FIFA 21 dataset project. This was a very messy project I had to tackle and clean in power bi using Power Query. Again the source of this dataset comes from kaggle. It's actually my go to place for datasets so yes. There is so much to this dataset, I cant wait.
So first and foremost, I downloaded the dataset as usual, and named it FIFA 21. I then moved on to cleaning the dataset. this was all abount cleaning the dataset and transforming it for use. mainly

# Data Cleaning

So in this dataset, we had the raw data, This dataset initially had 67 columns and 18980 rows. it was hella stressful honestly and the dataset looked really messy. kindly see it below:

After getting this dataset, we dropped some columns which didn't feel relevant, took the columns individually to standardize and a whole lot using power qwuery only. My final work can be seen below:
